===============================================================================

AUTHOR: Enrique Estevez Alvarez
DATE: October 1, 2025
DATASET: CIFAR-10 (60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes)

===============================================================================
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
===============================================================================

This project implements and compares two approaches for CIFAR-10 image classification:
1. A custom 6-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built from scratch
2. Transfer learning using pre-trained MobileNetV2

The MobileNetV2 transfer learning approach achieved the best performance with 75.56% 
accuracy, outperforming the custom CNN (73.37% accuracy). Both models were successfully 
deployed in a dual-model Flask web application hosted on Railway cloud platform.

===============================================================================
2. CHOSEN CNN ARCHITECTURE
===============================================================================

2.1 CUSTOM CNN ARCHITECTURE
----------------------------
The custom CNN consists of 6 convolutional layers with progressive channel expansion:

Layer Structure:
- Conv1: 3→32 channels, 3x3 kernel, stride=1, padding=1 + BatchNorm + ReLU
- Conv2: 32→32 channels, 3x3 kernel, stride=2, padding=1 + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool2d + Dropout(0.25)
- Conv3: 32→64 channels, 3x3 kernel, stride=1, padding=1 + BatchNorm + ReLU
- Conv4: 64→64 channels, 3x3 kernel, stride=2, padding=1 + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool2d + Dropout(0.25)
- Conv5: 64→128 channels, 3x3 kernel, stride=1, padding=1 + BatchNorm + ReLU
- Conv6: 128→128 channels, 3x3 kernel, stride=1, padding=1 + BatchNorm + ReLU + MaxPool2d + Dropout(0.25)

Fully Connected Layers:
- FC1: 512 neurons + ReLU + Dropout(0.5)
- FC2: 10 neurons (output classes)

Design Rationale:
- Progressive channel expansion (3→32→64→128) captures increasingly complex features
- Batch normalization accelerates training and improves stability
- Dropout layers prevent overfitting
- MaxPooling reduces spatial dimensions efficiently
- Dynamic FC layer sizing handles varying input dimensions

2.2 TRANSFER LEARNING ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------------------
MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet:
- Backbone: MobileNetV2 feature extractor (frozen during training)
- Modified classifier: Linear layer (1280 → 10 classes)
- Input preprocessing: Resized to 224x224, ImageNet normalization

Selection Justification:
- Lightweight architecture suitable for mobile deployment
- Excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off
- Pre-trained features from ImageNet transfer well to CIFAR-10
- Designed for smaller image classification tasks
