# Project Guide: Deep Learning Image Classification with CNN

This guide will help you systematically address each of the 7 assessment components in your README.md for your image classification project.

---

## 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Loading:** Start by loading your chosen dataset (CIFAR-10 or Animals10). Use the appropriate library (e.g., torchvision for CIFAR-10).
- **Normalization:** Adjust pixel values so they have a mean and standard deviation close to zero. This helps the model train faster and more reliably.
- **Resizing:** If your dataset images are not all the same size, resize them to a consistent shape (e.g., 32x32 for CIFAR-10).
- **Augmentation:** Apply random transformations (flipping, cropping, rotation) to increase data diversity and help prevent overfitting.
- **Visualization:** Display a few sample images and their labels to confirm correct loading and preprocessing.

## 2. Model Architecture

- **Design a CNN:** Build a neural network with convolutional layers to extract features, pooling layers to reduce spatial dimensions, and fully connected layers for classification.
- **Layer Choices:** Start simple (2-3 convolutional layers, pooling, 1-2 dense layers). Experiment with deeper or more complex architectures if needed.
- **Output Layer:** Ensure the final layer matches the number of classes in your dataset and uses an appropriate activation function (e.g., softmax).

## 3. Model Training

- **Optimizer:** Choose an optimization algorithm (Adam or SGD). Adam is often a good starting point.
- **Loss Function:** Use cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
- **Training Loop:** Train your model for several epochs, monitoring loss and accuracy.
- **Early Stopping:** Stop training if validation loss stops improving to avoid overfitting.
- **Save Best Model:** Keep the weights of the best-performing model for later evaluation.

---

## 4. Model Evaluation

- **Validation:** Evaluate your model on a separate validation or test set.
- **Metrics:** Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visualize the confusion matrix to understand which classes are being misclassified.

---

## 5. Transfer Learning

- **Pre-trained Models:** Choose a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, Inception, ResNet) and justify your choice based on your dataset and goals.
- **Fine-tuning:** Adapt the pre-trained model to your dataset by retraining some layers.
- **Comparison:** Compare the performance of your custom CNN and the transfer learning approach. Choose the best model.

---

## 6. Code Quality

- **Structure:** Organize your code into clear sections (data loading, preprocessing, model definition, training, evaluation).
- **Comments:** Add comments explaining each step and function.
- **Documentation:** Document your functions and processes for clarity.
- **Efficiency:** Use libraries and resources efficiently (e.g., GPU acceleration if available).

---

## 7. Report & Model Deployment

- **Report:** Write a concise report describing your approach, architecture, preprocessing, training process, results, and insights. Include visualizations and diagrams.
- **Deployment:** Deploy your best model using Flask. Build an app that allows users to upload images and get predictions (with probabilities). Consider hosting options beyond your laptop for bonus points (e.g., cloud, Tensorflow Serving).

**Tip:** For each step, explain your choices and reasoning. Visualize results and learning curves. Compare models and justify your final selection.
