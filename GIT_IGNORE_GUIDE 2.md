### Large Model Files:
- `*.pth` (PyTorch model files - including best_model_cifar10.pth)
- `*.h5` (TensorFlow model files)
- `*.pb`, `saved_model/` (TensorFlow SavedModel format)

### Dataset Files:
- `cifar10_data/` (entire CIFAR-10 dataset directory)
- `data/` (any data directories)
- `*.tar.gz`, `*.zip` (compressed dataset files)

### Cache and Temporary Files:
- `__pycache__/` (Python bytecode cache)
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` (Jupyter notebook checkpoints)
- `*.log` (log files)
- `.DS_Store` (macOS system files)

### Development Files:
- `venv/`, `env/` (virtual environments)
- `.vscode/`, `.idea/` (IDE configuration)
- `node_modules/` (if using any Node.js tools)

### Upload Directory:
- `cloud_deployment/static/uploads/*` (user uploaded files)

## ‚úÖ Files INCLUDED in Git (Will be pushed):

### Core Project Files:
- `Project.ipynb` (main notebook)
- `CNN_Project_Report.txt` (your report)
- `README.md` (documentation)

### Application Code:
- `cloud_deployment/app.py` (Flask application)
- `cloud_deployment/requirements.txt` (dependencies)
- `cloud_deployment/templates/*.html` (web templates)
- `cloud_deployment/Procfile` (deployment config)

### Configuration Files:
- `.gitignore` (this ignore configuration)
- `railway.json` (Railway deployment config)

## üìù Note for Deployment:

Since model files are excluded, you have two options:

1. **Train models locally**: Run the notebooks to generate model files
2. **Use Git LFS**: For tracking large files (requires setup)
3. **Cloud storage**: Upload models to cloud storage and download during deployment

The Flask app will handle missing models gracefully and show appropriate error messages.
